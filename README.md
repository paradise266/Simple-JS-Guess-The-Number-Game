# Simple-JS-Guess-The-Number-Game

A small video game project that I created as part of a learning course on Udemy. All UI and functionalities are written in bare JS, HTML and CSS code.

The rule is simple: the game will randomize a number between 1 and 20, and you just have to guess it. Every time you input a wrong number, the game will tell you if it's too large or too low, helping you narrow down your choices. Currently the highscore function is not implemented.
